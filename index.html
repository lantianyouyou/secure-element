        A secure element is a tamper proof device, providing a secure storage
        and execution environment for sensitive data and processing. It offers
        both physical and logical protection against attacks, ensuring
        integrity and confidentiality of its content.

        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        The <cite>Secure Element API</cite> defined herein allows applications
        to interact with secure elements. Considered secure elements are those
        complying to [[!ISO7816-4]], which defines a command/response protocol,
        based on structured <abbr title="Application Data Unit">APDU</abbr>
        (Application Data Unit).

        <h2>
          Technical Background
        </h2>
        <p>
          Secure elements addressed by this specification are micro controllers
          that may come in different form factors, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Smart cards. The chip is embedded in a plastic card usually of
          the size of a typical credit card. The card may show physical
          contacts to communicate with the chip, or the chip may support
          <abbr title="Near Field Communication">NFC</abbr> (Near Field
          Communication), in which case the plastic card embeds an antenna.
          Some cards also support both communication methods.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a><abbr title="Universal Integrated Circuit Card">UICC</abbr></a>
            (Universal Integrated Circuit Card) are smart cards used in
            cellular telephony, which may be delivered in different sizes. They
            are often called <abbr title=
            "Subscriber Identity Module">SIM</abbr>, which is actually the name
            of the application hosted by the <a>UICC</a> to access GSM
            networks. <a>UICC</a> may however host other applications.
          </li>
          <li>Smart <abbr title="Storage Device">SD</abbr> cards have a similar
          form as usual SD cards, but internally include a secure element, and
          support an extended set of SD commands to communicate with the secure
          element. Some of these smart SD cards also support NFC.
          </li>
          <li>Embedded secure elements, which are chips directly bonded on the
          device mother board. Unlike other form factors, this one does not
          allow interchanging or extracting the secure element, it is
          permanently attached to the device.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Similarly to a computer, a secure element may host one or multiple
          applications. Typical applications are mobile network authentication
          (SIM cards), payment (credit cards), authentication and signature
          (corporate badges, eID, etc.), loyalty, ticketing (public
          transports). But these are only examples, many other applications
          have been and can be deployed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Applications hosted by the secure elements are commonly named
          <dfn>on-card</dfn> applications. Considering the limited, if any,
          user interface of these devices, and application can only be useful
          for a user if there is also an off-card application part, which
          handle the dialog with the user, or with external computing
          resources. Examples of <dfn>off-card</dfn> applications are
          <abbr title="Automatic Toll Machines">ATM</abbr> for payment, mail
          applications for signature, access control doors for authentication,
          etc. This specification defines the API to be used by off-card
          applications based on web technologies.

        <h2>
          Use Cases
        </h2>
        <p>
          This specification allows development of web applications making use
          of these secure element applications. Some typical use cases that
          applications can address based on this API include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Authentication:</strong> Instead of user name and password,
            access to an online service may be protected by a strong
            authentication mechanism, based on credentials stored and processed
            in a secure element. In web-based operating systems, system
            applications such as <abbr title=
            "Virtual Private Network">VPN</abbr> (Virtual Private Network) or
            eMail application may use of the secure element to authenticate the
            user.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Digital Signature:</strong> Applications may use the secure
            element to digitally sign a document or any data with a key stored
            in this secure element. The signature operation itself is executed
            inside the secure element, ensuring both the integrity of the
            signature and the confidentiality of the key used in this process.
            For instance, this could be used by an eMail application to sign
            emails sent by the user. Or by a government web application to sign
            a online administrative request.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Payment:</strong> Online commerce may use widely used smart
            credit cards, or specific payment applications, to enforce the
            security of online transactions. On cellular telephony environment,
            the on-card payment application may be hosted on the SIM card,
            alleviating the need for the user to handle multiple physical
            devices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Credential provisioning:</strong> The content of a secure
            element may be updated to install, update or remove an application
            or any credential it may host. For instance a public transport
            application may offer a user to credit her NFC-enabled transport
            card with tickets bought online. Or a corporate intranet web
            application may offer employees to renew online the X.509
            certificates hosted in their corporate badge, so that they can do
            this operation from anywhere just before these certificates expire.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Whatever the form factor listed above, secure element considered in
          this specification implement the same [[!ISO7816-4]] transport
          protocol. The physical media (USB, NFC, or any other wired or
          wireless technique) used in this communication is abstracted by the
          API defined in this specification.

      <section>
        <h2>
          Relationship to other W3C APIs
        </h2>
        <p>
          This specification, although addressing some concepts similar to
          other W3C specifications, has distinct use cases and offer different
          level of services:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The current NFC API draft specification [[NFC]] defines an API
          allowing to exchange NDEF messages with NFC tags or peers. While the
          Secure Element API specified herein allows web applications to send
          commands to secure elements wired or plugged in the device, or
          wirelessly connected to the device thanks to NFC technology. The
          difference between the different communication links (wired or NFC)
          is only visible through secure element type in this API, but does not
          impact the way applications would interact with the secure element.
          As such there is no overlap of functionalities between the two APIs.
          </li>
          <li>The Web Cryptography API draft specification [[WEBCRYPTO]]
          defines an API allowing a web application to invoke cryptographic
          services. Its implementation is independent from the underlying
          layers performing the actual cryptographic operations: it might be
          pure software, or use a dedicated hardware such as a secure element
          or a TPM. As such there is not overlap between the two APIs.
          Nevertheless one can imagine that the User Agent implementing the Web
          Cryptography API may rely on the Secure Element API, but this will be
          implementation dependent.

        Security and privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Using a secure element may bring additional security to a web
        application, but is not sufficient to ensure the application is secure.
        In particular, developers using the Secure Element API should be aware
        of the following security considerations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Communication</strong> between the secure element and the web
          application has to be secured, in order to ensure the confidentiality
          and integrity of the message exchange. This can either be achieved if
          the web application using the secure element API executes in a
          trusted execution environment offering guarantees on the integrity
          and confidentiality of the communication link. Or it can be provided
          programmatically by encryption and/or MACing of the messages
          exchanged with the secure element (e.g. using GlobalPlatform's secure
          messaging technology [[GP]]). The off-card processing of these
          messages has then to be done in a trusted execution environment,
          which may be on the device to which the secure element is connected,
          or on a remote device (e.g. the web application's originating
          server).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Interface</strong> between the user and the web application
          typically consists in displayed text and images (e.g. a transaction
          confirmation dialog), and user inputs (e.g. a PIN code). Protecting
          this interface is out of the scope of this specification. If the
          application requires such guarantee, it should restrict its execution
          on Trusted Execution Environments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Access</strong> to secure element applications should be
          restricted to authorized parties. Secure element embedded application
          usually enforce such control by requiring authentication of the
          off-card communicating party, for instance by asking user to present
          a PIN to unlock access, or performing a mutual authentication before
          any sensitive operation.<br>
          There is however a risk of denial of service (DoS) attacks, where an
          attacker would e.g. deliberately present multiple invalid PIN values
          to block the secure element, or sending burst of commands preventing
          legitimate applications to execute optimally. In order to mitigate
          this risk, this specification requires the web application runtime to
          implement the access control mechanism defined in <a href=
          "#access-control">Access Control</a> section.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Traceability</strong> of the user may be facilitated by the
          unique identifying information the secure element may contain. Here
          again, the access control defined in <a href="#access-control">Access
          Control</a> section will ensure only trusted applications have access
          to the secure element API.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        Secure Element services
      </h2>
      <p>
        Communication with a secure element is performed through a
        <dfn>reader</dfn>, which unlike its name suggests it not only able to
        read content from secure element, but also to write or send any
        application specific command. Given the removal nature of many secure
        elements, a reader may be empty, meaning that no secure element is
        connected to this reader. For instance, a USB smart card reader may be
        connected to a computer, but no smart card is inserted. Or a device may
        support NFC interactions with secure elements, but none is in the
        field. For this reason, the API provides a mean to query the list of
        available readers, and for each of them if they are empty or if a
        secure element is present. In addition, this specification defines
        events that are triggered when a secure element is connected to a
        reader, and also when it is disconnected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a web application is informed that a reader has a connected secure
        element, it can open a <dfn>session</dfn> with it. Opening a session
        establishes the communication between the web application and the
        secure element, and provides a session object to the application.
        However a secure element is just an application container, and the web
        application still needs to identify the application with which it wants
        to communicate.
      </p>
      <p>
        To this intent, the session object provides a mean to open a
        <dfn>channel</dfn> with a specific secure element application, which is
        uniquely identified by an <a>AID</a>. The web application runtime and
        the secure element may then perform some internal security checking to
        ensure the web application is allowed to connect to this secure element
        application. If authorized, the returned channel object is the one
        providing the method to send commands to the secure element
        application, and get the corresponding responses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The above steps required to send a command to a secure element creates
        a set of chained objects. A reader may have several opened sessions,
        which may have several opened channels. Each object has a
        <code>close()</code> method to release all ressources associated to the
        target object, and invoke <code>close()</code> method on all underlying
        objects in the chain.

      <p>
        In order to make sure only trusted applications are allowed to use this
        API, the web application runtime MUST implement the access control
        defined in [[GP-AC]], which defines a simple mechanism that protects
        legitimate users using non-compromised devices from malicious
        applications. Note that it does not protect from a compromised device
        that would not properly implement the Access Control Enforcer, which is

          Overall architecture
        </h3>
        <p>
          To control which applications running on a user device are allowed to
          access secure element applications, several entities are involved:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The secure element hosts a list of <a>Access Rules</a>. An access
          rule contains the <a>AID</a> of the secure element application to
          control access to, and the identifier of the requesting application
          running on the device, as well as a filter on authorized APDUs, or a
          simple boolean to authorize all or no communications.
          </li>
          <li>An <a>Access Control Enforcer</a> is running on the device of the
          client application, inside the web application runtime. Any attempt
          to establish a communication with a secure element application from
          this device triggers this enforcer, which queries the secure element
          to get the access rules (and usually cache them), and check that the
          requesting application is authorized to communicate with the targeted
          secure element application.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Trusted application identifier
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <a>Access Control Enforcer</a> uses an application identifier to
          check whether the application is white listed in <a>Access Rules</a>.
          This identifier needs to be trustworthy so that only authorized
          application may have a given identifier. Web applications use the
          certificate-based identifier as defined in [[!GP-AC]]:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The web application MUST be associated with a web application <a>
            manifest</a> file, as defined in [[!MANIFEST]]. This manifest MUST
            contain a <dfn id=
            "member-se_signature_url"><code>se_author_signature</code></dfn>
            member, which value MUST be the relative URI to the <a>author
            signature file</a>.
          </li>
          <li>The <a>author signature file</a> MUST be an <a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets-digsig/#author-signatures">author
          signature</a> as defined in [[!WDSIG]]. The signature algorithm
          depends on the application URI scheme:
            <ul>
              <li>For applications with an <code>app</code> URI scheme, the
              signed data MUST be the complete set of application files,
              excluding signature files themselves. The algorithm used for
              <a href=
              "http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets-digsig/#generating-a-digital-signature">
                generating a digital signature</a> is defined in [[!WDSIG]].
                Resources not listed in the signature file MUST NOT not be
                granted the application's access to the Secure Element API.
              </li>
              <li>For applications with an <code>https</code> URI scheme, the
              signed data MUST be the [[!RFC6454]] serialization of the
              <a>origin</a> to be granted access. Only applications that are
              <a>same-origin</a> will be granted access.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The <a>author certificate</a> is the certificate used to compute
          the digital signature, and its value is included in the <a>author
          signature file</a>. It MAY be a self-signed certificate. This
          certificate, and the certificates part of its issuance chain, if any,
          MUST be valid:
            <ul>
              <li>the current date MUST be inside the certificate validity
              dates;
              </li>
              <li>the certificate signature MUST be valid;
              </li>
              <li>If a revocation endpoint is set in the certificate, the
              runtime MUST use it to check this certificate is not revoked.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The SHA-1 digest of the <a>author certificate</a> is used as the
          device application identifier in the access control verification
          process, following the GlobalPlatform Access Control process.
            <div class="note">
              The SHA-1 hash function is used here because the GlobalPlatform
              Access Control specification for now only supports 20 bytes long
              identifiers. A stronger algorithm will be used as soon as
              GlobalPlatform updates its specification to support longer
              values.

        <p>
          When an application is not accessed using an <code>app</code> URI,
          the origin and integrity of its resources must be guaranteed using
          the following security restriction:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>To be eligible to gain access to the Secure Element API, a hosted
          web application MUST be fetched using HTTPS protocol.
          </li>
          <li>The TLS/SSL server certificate of this HTTPS connection MUST be
          trusted and valid:
            <ul>
              <li>Its subject MUST match the hosting domain name.
              </li>
              <li>Its validity dates MUST include the current date provided by
              the execution runtime.
              </li>
              <li>The issuance signature chain MUST be valid.
              </li>
              <li>The issuance chain MUST be rooted by a CA trusted by the web
              application runtime.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The user MUST NOT be able to bypass these rules. Some browsers
          offer users to define "exceptions" to allow connections to a HTTPS
          URL even if SSL server certificate is invalid. Such exception MUST
          NOT be used to allow access to the Secure Element API.

        Given the removable nature of some secure elements, a reader may or may
        not have a secure element present. A reader may have at most one
        present secure element simultaneously. A reader MAY for instance be a
        <a>UICC</a> slot, a USB smart card reader, an NFC interface, or a
        mother board slot where a embedded secure element is wired.

          This method closes this session object. If a transmit operation is
          still waiting for the secure element response, the user agent must
          terminate that asynchronous operation with a <code>closed</code>
          error status. Invoking <code>close()</code> method on an already
          closed channel is an idempotent operation.

      <p>
        The javascript code excerpt below shows how a web application can wait
        for a card to be present, and send it an APDU command:
      </p>
      <pre class="example highlight">

            // my application identifier
            var myAppId = ...;
            // my application command
            var myAppCmd = new SECommand(...);

            // get secure element manager
            var seMgr = navigator.secureElementManager;

            // register sepresent event handler
            seMgr.onsepresent = function(reader) {

              // open session
              reader.openSession()
              .then(

                function (session) {
                  // open a basic channel to my application
                  return session.openBasicChannel(myAppID);
                }

              ).then(

                function (channel) {
                  // open a basic channel to my application
                  return channel.transmit(myAppCmd);
                }

              ).then(

                function (response) {
                  if (!response.isStatus(0x90, 0x00) {
                    // this might be an error
                    // ...
                  }
                  response.channel.session.reader.close();
                }

              );
            };

</pre>
      <p>
        For simplicity and readability reasons, the code above omits the error
        handling that would have to be done in a real application.
